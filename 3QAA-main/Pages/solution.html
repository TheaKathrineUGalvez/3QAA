  <p class="description">The most simple and practical solution for this SDG would be recycling. Recycling may seem like a small solution but it does a lot for our environment. By recycling, this will achieve our goal as a responsible consumer and producer. By recycling, this also saves the amount of waste being produced. Recycling is also a good solution because it is already imposed in the laws of most countries, although there are certain companies and people that bypass these laws, majority of the public are working and fighting harder to advocate these policies and methods of recycling. Furthermore, countries are imposing stricter rules and policies on these to protect the environment and to continue protecting and promoting the SDG's, especially SDG 12. </p>
